✅ Order to run

Seed DB (insert initial users) → run seed_script.py

Start FastAPI server → uvicorn src.main:app --reload

Open Swagger → test endpoints

Perfect! Let’s **analyze your folder structure** and explain **what each folder/file is doing** compared to your FastAPI `E3.1 User Management` code. I’ll also compare it to a **real-life office analogy** so it’s easy to understand.

---

# **1️⃣ Root Level**

```
admin-dashboard-service/
│── README.md
│── requirements.txt / pyproject.toml
│── docker-compose.yml
│── .env
│── .gitignore
```

**Explanation:**

* `README.md` → Project documentation (like office manual).
* `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` → Python dependencies (tools/staff needed).
* `docker-compose.yml` → Docker setup (like preparing office infrastructure with computers + network).
* `.env` → Environment variables (DB URL, JWT secret – like office confidential info).
* `.gitignore` → Files not to track in version control (temporary stuff).

---

# **2️⃣ src/** – Main source code

```
src/
├── main.py
├── config/
├── common/
├── models/
├── squads/
├── migrations/
└── docs/
```

---

## **2.1 main.py**

* Entrypoint of your app (like **office building entrance**)
* Creates DB tables, starts FastAPI server, includes squad routers.

---

## **2.2 config/**

```
config/
└── settings.py
```

* Stores project-level settings (DB URL, JWT secrets)
* Like the **office rulebook**: tells staff how to connect to DB, what secrets to use, project name, etc.

---

## **2.3 common/** – Shared utilities

```
common/
├── database.py     # DB engine + sessions
├── logger.py       # Central logging
├── events.py       # Event emitters (e.g., admin.action.logged)
├── rbac.py         # Role-based access
└── exceptions.py   # Custom exceptions
```

* These are **shared staff/tools** used by all squads:

  * `database.py` → assistant to open/close drawers (DB sessions)
  * `logger.py` → diary/office logbook
  * `events.py` → notify other departments about actions
  * `rbac.py` → who can do what (roles & permissions)
  * `exceptions.py` → handle errors in a structured way

---

## **2.4 models/** – ORM Models

```
models/
├── admin_flags.py   # Admin actions / audit logs
├── disputes.py      # User table
├── audit_logs.py    # Global audit logs (optional)
└── __init__.py
```

* These are **filing cabinets** storing real-life info:

  * `User` table → user info
  * `AdminAction` → admin logs
* Squads use these models to read/write info.

---

## **2.5 squads/** – Modular services

```
squads/
├── e3_1_user_mgmt/  # User management squad
├── e3_2_marketplace/
├── e3_3_services/
├── e3_4_payments/
├── e3_5_analytics/
└── __init__.py
```

**Each squad = a department in your office.**

Example: **e3\_1\_user\_mgmt/**

```
routes.py    → front-desk window (API endpoints)
service.py   → staff doing actual work (business logic)
schema.py    → official forms/checklists (Pydantic models)
tests/       → unit/integration tests (staff QA)
```

Other squads follow the same structure but handle different responsibilities (marketplace, payments, analytics).

---

## **2.6 migrations/**

* DB migrations (Alembic/Django)
* Like **keeping old/new office forms** and tracking changes in the filing cabinet.

---

## **2.7 docs/**

* Swagger/OpenAPI specs
* **User manual** for API: shows how endpoints work

---

# **3️⃣ tests/** – Global tests

```
tests/
├── conftest.py             # Fixtures
├── test_auth.py            # Authentication tests
├── test_rbac.py            # Role-based access tests
└── test_integration_flow.py # End-to-end flow tests
```

* Like **QA team** in the office making sure every department works correctly.
* Squads also have **squad-level tests** inside their `tests/` folder.

---

# **4️⃣ scripts/** – Deployment & DevOps

```
scripts/
├── run_local.sh   # Start server locally
└── seed_db.py     # Insert initial users
```

* Like **office helpers**:

  * `run_local.sh` → turn on office computers
  * `seed_db.py` → populate filing cabinets with initial users

---

# **5️⃣ How it all connects (E3.1 User Management example)**

```
Admin clicks Suspend
   |
routes.py -> receives API request
   |
service.py -> checks User table, updates status
   |
models/ -> DB update, logs in AdminAction
   |
schemas.py -> validate request & response
   |
Return response -> admin sees "User suspended successfully"
```

**Thunglish analogy:**

* Admin = boss
* Routes.py = front-desk window
* Service.py = staff behind the window
* Models/DB = filing cabinet
* Schema = forms/checklists
* Common utils = office tools shared by all departments

---

If you want, I can make a **diagram image of this folder structure with flow arrows**, so you can **see squad structure, DB, and request flow visually**.

Do you want me to do that?
